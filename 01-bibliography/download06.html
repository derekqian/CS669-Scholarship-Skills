<p>This page contains my annotated bibliography on Association
Rules. The annotation is kept very concise and only serves as a
guide to what paper one should read to find information on a
certain aspect of association rule mining. The bibliography is not
complete or comprehensive, but it should cover the milestones in
mainstream research efforts. The bibliography is organized as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="#algorithm">Mining association rules (using support
and confidence)</a>:</b> Algorithms which directly find frequent
itemsets.</li>

<li><b><a href="#measure">Alternative interest measures (besides
confidence)</a>:</b> Other measures of interest to remedy
shortcomings of the support-confidence framework.</li>

<li><b><a href="#var-support_no-support">Mining rules without or
with a variable support threshold</a>:</b> Techniques which deal
with the shortcomings of support (e.g.,rare item problem).</li>

<li><b><a href="#constraint">Constraint-based mining</a>:</b>
Algorithms which use additional constraints (e.g., presence of an
item or max number of rules) to reduce the search space.</li>

<li><b><a href="#sequential_generalized_quantitative_causal">Mining
sequential, generalized, quantitative or causal rules</a>:</b>
Deals with special types of rules.</li>

<li><b><a href="#closed_maximal_concise">Concise representations of
frequent itemsets (closed, maximal, ect.)</a>:</b> Focuses on
closed and maximal frequent itemsets which are typically by orders
of magnitude fewer itemsets than all frequent itemsets. However,
all frequent itemsets can be induced from these itemsets and thus
algorithms mining closed and maximal frequent itemsets are often
more efficient.</li>

<li><b><a href="#classification">Using association rules for
classification</a>:</b> Association rules are used to discover
classification rules or to build classifiers.</li>

<li><b><a href="#changing">Evolution of association rules over
time</a>:</b> Methods to find changes in data by analyzing changes
in association rules found in the data (typically by splitting the
data set into several parts and comparing the association rules
found in the individual parts).</li>

<li><b><a href="#theory_sampling_clustering">Theoretic
considerations and sampling</a>:</b> Discusses theoretic issues of
rule mining (e.g., properties of lattices and measures, sampling,
clustering).</li>

<li><b><a href="#evaluation_implementation">Evaluation and
efficient implementation of rule mining algorithms</a>:</b> Deals
with the comparison of algorithms, generation of synthetic data and
the implementation issues of mining algorithms.</li>

best-known algorithm; it uses a breadth-first search strategy to
counting the support of itemsets). The algorithm uses an improved
candidate generation function which exploits the downward closure
property of support and makes it more efficient than AIS. Also an
algorithm to generate synthetic transaction data is presented. Such
synthetic transaction data are widely used for the evaluation and

<font size="-1">Search for unusually frequent itemsets using
statistical methods. First, the authors propose stratification of
the data to avoid finding spurious associations within strata. Then
the deviation of the observed frequency over a baseline frequency
(based on independence) is used. Since the deviation is unreliable
for low counts, an empirical Bayes model (its 95% confidence limit)
is used to produce a posterior distribution of the true ratio of
actual to baseline frequencies. The Bayes model gives ratios close
to the observed ratios for large samples and reduces (shrinks) the
ratio if the sample size gets small (to smooth away noise). For
multi-item associations log-linear models are proposed to find
higher order associations which cannot be explained by pairwise
associations.</font>

<blockquote>
<font size="-1">Omiecinski introduced several alternatives to
support. The first measure, ANY-CONFIDENCE, is defined as the
confidence of the rule with the largest confidence which can be
generated from an itemset. The author states that although finding
all itemsets with a set any-confidence would enable us to find all
rules with a given minimum confidence, any-confidence cannot be
used efficiently as a measure of interestingness since confidence
is not downward closed. The second introduced measure is
ALL-CONFIDENCE. This measure is defined as the smallest confidence
of all rules which can be produced from an itemset, i.e., all rules
produced form an itemset will have a confidence greater or equal to
its all-confidence value. BOND, the last measure, is defined as the
ratio of the number of transactions which contain all items of an
itemset to the number of transactions which contain at least one of
these items. Omiecinski showed that bond and all-confidence are
downward closed and, therefore, can be used for efficient mining
algorithms.</font>

measure called h-confidence (equal to all-confidence by Omiecinski,

so-called cross-support patterns (patterns with items with
substantially different support) is avoided by h-confidence's
cross-support property.</font>

uses a fast hash-based elimination of non-closed itemsets. (c) It

<font size="-1">Search for unusually frequent itemsets using
statistical methods. First, the authors propose stratification of
the data to avoid finding spurious associations within strata. Then
the deviation of the observed frequency over a baseline frequency
(based on independence) is used. Since the deviation is unreliable
for low counts, an empirical Bayes model (its 95% confidence limit)
is used to produce a posterior distribution of the true ratio of
actual to baseline frequencies. The Bayes model gives ratios close
to the observed ratios for large samples and reduces (shrinks) the
ratio if the sample size gets small (to smooth away noise). For
multi-item associations log-linear models are proposed to find
higher order associations which cannot be explained by pairwise
associations.</font>
