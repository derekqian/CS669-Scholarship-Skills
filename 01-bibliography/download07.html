	<meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="en" content=" Although we are increasingly familiar with the channels of digitally mediated surveillance, we continue to struggle to understand the kinds of analyses to which our data are subject and the implications of the practices that rely on the results of those analyses.&amp;nbsp; Even those instances of data capture with which we are most familiar continue to defy our complete understanding because they feed processes of data matching (aggregation), data mining, and data-driven decisions (profiling) that tend to be outside our purview and beyond our comprehension.&amp;nbsp; Data mining is therefore the focus of this proposed annotated bibliography.   &amp;nbsp;   For all the recent controversy, data mining is actually a well-established practice in marketing, advertising, and strategic communication, in consumer and corporate finance and banking, and perhaps most of all in insurance.&amp;nbsp; It has also gained steady traction in policing and counterterrorism, in clinical and research medicine, and in all sorts of web-based services.&amp;nbsp; While some of these practices are quite familiar to Surveillance Studies and its cognate fields&amp;mdash;not least because of the rich literature on risk and the actuarial turn&amp;mdash;there is far more to discover beyond the social theoretical work that has often dominated the field&amp;rsquo;s attention thus far.&amp;nbsp; Data mining has actually been the subject of significant inquiry outside its home discipline and across a diverse range of fields; I&amp;rsquo;ve divided these into separate sections:   &amp;nbsp;    Data Mining as a Discipline:&amp;nbsp; The early work within the field, which helped set a research program and secure disciplinary boundaries, is revelatory.&amp;nbsp; Here we discover the field&amp;rsquo;s excitement over brute force induction, its ambitions to colonize other fields, and its foundational assumptions and biases.     &amp;nbsp;    Big Data: The new wave of writing on data mining which has accompanied the growth of the internet&amp;mdash;the &amp;lsquo;big data&amp;rsquo; craze&amp;mdash;retreads many of these issues, with a new focus on information superabundance and the possibility of performing analyses on the full subject population.&amp;nbsp;     &amp;nbsp;    Data Mining in Contexts&amp;mdash;Business, Marketing, Government, Medicine: More specialized work on the application of data mining to business, marketing, government services, and medicine reveal what was perceived to be the enormous potential of data mining to rationalize, optimize, and grow these services, often with little regard for their social, political, and ethical implications.&amp;nbsp; Critical scholarship on the issues that are particular to each of these domains quickly followed, and I&amp;rsquo;ve included some of these here.    &amp;nbsp;    Data Mining in/as Practice: Early debates within the more technical fields focused on the challenges of making what was later considered an automated process actually work in practice.&amp;nbsp; Here we find unexpected attention to the mundane practical aspects of working through the knowledge discovery process&amp;mdash;including everything from asking the right question to gathering and preparing the data to making use of results.&amp;nbsp; No other literature tells us as much about the actual practice of data mining&amp;mdash;something simultaneously social, analytical, technical, and material&amp;mdash;as this collection of readings.    &amp;nbsp;    Data Mining and Privacy&amp;mdash;Views from within the Field: Without diving into the technical literature on privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM), these readings reveal the field&amp;rsquo;s own views on privacy, discrimination, bias, autonomy, and opacity.&amp;nbsp; Many of these concerns were voiced much earlier than the critical literature would suggest&amp;mdash;and they were often explained with a precision and clarity that makes their neglect within and outside the field especially disappointing.    &amp;nbsp;    Applied, Computer, and Business Ethics: An enormously rich literature has developed in applied, computer, and business ethics on the topic of data mining.&amp;nbsp; These tackle the ethical issues of data mining in careful detail, often with special attention to the mechanics of the analyses that data mining perform and the kinds of results the follow.&amp;nbsp; These articles are especially attuned to the implications that often escape the traditional rubric of privacy and data protection.    &amp;nbsp;    Information Law and Data Mining: The legal scholarship on data mining has generally focused on government data mining where constitutional rights create some structure to reason about the legal standing of data mining.&amp;nbsp; Given its explicit focus on deriving and inferring additional (i.e., non-disclosed) information from a set of disclosed facts, data mining is a quagmire in countries with data protection or even in certain industries that are subject to sectoral privacy laws.&amp;nbsp; In all contexts, there is enormous debate about data mining&amp;rsquo;s legality and desirability.    &amp;nbsp;    Philosophy of Law and Data Mining: Straddling the work on the ethics and the law is a collection of European authors who examine both the moral and legal standing of data mining and the impact data mining may have on the law itself.     &amp;nbsp;    Decision-Making: Empirical Findings: This brief section collections empirical work on the relative merits of expert judgment and automated decision-making.    &amp;nbsp;   I&amp;rsquo;ve also put together three additional sections that I set off as important, but perhaps distracting, additions. &amp;nbsp;The first two concern data mining and terrorism, the topic that perhaps most forcefully launched data mining into the pubic consciousness.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;ve assembled what I believe may be an exhaustive collection of the legal writings on the issue&amp;mdash;the full debate, as it were.&amp;nbsp; And I&amp;rsquo;ve complimented this list with a limited collection of related writings from social theory, social science, and public policy, though I&amp;rsquo;ve excluded much of the work in Security Studies and Surveillance Studies, as I expect that these are well known.&amp;nbsp; I don&amp;rsquo;t include these in the overall bibliography because I fear that they might crowd-out other topics.&amp;nbsp; Finally, I end with a list devoted to Ambient Intelligence, Pervasive Computing, and Ubiquitous Computing, which&amp;mdash;because generally supported by profiling&amp;mdash;present many of the same issues and concerns as data mining, even though the extreme visions of ambient intelligence that animate much of this work remain largely hypothetical for the moment.   &amp;nbsp;   I&amp;rsquo;ve included an exhaustive bibliography below, but I&amp;rsquo;ve highlighted potential choices for each section.&amp;nbsp; I thought I&amp;rsquo;d leave open the possibility for discussion on the final selection.
