This annotated bibliography discusses the techniques used to verify the consistencies
between the software and the documents written in natual language. The software could
use a variety of programming languages, like C/C++, Java, PHP and etc.. The documents
could be in the form of programming language comments, Java annotation or seperate
files.
% Definitions that are required by several of the annotations could go here too.
